<------------MissionaryCannibal.lisp--------------->
1. Solve the missionaries and cannibals problem assuming that we have one boat, and 15 cannibals and 15 missionaries.
Assume that the boat can carry at most six people and there is a single boat available. You cannot also have the 
boat moving with no one onboard. The cannibals should never outnumber the missionaries (either on the boat or at 
both sides of the river).


<-------------8Puzzle.lisp------------------------>

2. Implement the A* search for searching trees (in Lisp). Do not use Russellâ€™s code or other
code from the web. Implement a counter that counts the number of nodes expanded and prints this
number at the end of the search. Use your code to solve the 8-puzzle problem with the heuristic
being the number of misplaced tiles and start state ((E, 1, 3),(4, 2, 5),(7, 8, 6)). The goal state is:
((1, 2, 3),(4, 5, 6),(7, 8, E)). Print the number of nodes expanded. You only need to show the states
generated during the search process. Code Will detect infeasible puzzles.
